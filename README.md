Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining applications.

                        IMPORTANCE
 It ensures high-quality software by testing, debugging, and code revewing
 It enhances efficiency and productivity by using structured methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and Waterfall. Software engineers streamline the development process, reducing time and cost.
Enables Scalability and Innovation: As businesses grow, software solutions must adapt. Software engineering ensures applications can scale and integrate with new technologies.
Supports Business Operations. Many industries rely on software solutions for daily operations, including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and education.
Improves Cybersecurity – Secure coding practices and threat mitigation strategies help protect software from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks.
Drives Technological Advancements – AI, cloud computing, IoT, and blockchain are all powered by software engineering, pushing the boundaries of innovation.

Job Creation and Economic Growth – The demand for software engineers continues to rise, making it a crucial field for employment and economic development.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning- this is the phase of defining goals, analysing, resource allocation, and risk assessment
Requirement analysis- This is a phase where developers and stakeholders gather and document functional and nonfunctional requirements to ensure the software meets user needs.
Design- this is where system architecture, database structure, and user interface are planned. This includes high-level and low-level design
Coding- This is where developers transform an idea into a working software product by writing the actual code  based on design specifications
Testing- this is where the software undergoes rigorous testing and identifying and fixing bugs before deployment
This is where software is released for use, and it may be launched in phases such as beta testing
Maintenance and support- after deployment, updates, bug fixing and improvemments are made to ensure the software remains functional and up to date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. The 
waterfall process is linear and step-by-step, while agile involves the iterative and flexible process
Waterfall changes are difficult to make while agile changes are easier to adjust
wttaerfall uuser involment is minimal until the end while agile user involvement is high and contionous feedback
The waterfall testing phase is after development, while the agile testing phase is throughout the development
Waterfall is best for fixed and well-defined projects, while agile is best for dynamic, evolving projects



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
